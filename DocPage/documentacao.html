				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
					language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
					objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
					language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
					extended
					for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
						its
						Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
						elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
						navigation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
						JavaScript
						on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
						database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application,
						or
						perform file manipulations on a server.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
					JavaScript
					language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
					follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was
					the
					reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
					runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
					values.
					JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.
					The
					prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
					individual
					objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
					can
					be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
					classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
					protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
					types
					are not explicitly typed.

				<h2>Hello World</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
					JavaScript code:
				</p>
				<code>
					function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
					greetMe("World");
				</code>
				<p>
					Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

				<h2>Variables</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
					identifiers, conform to certain rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
					characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
					characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
					Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
					temp99, and _name.

				<h2>Declaring variables</h2>
			</header>
			<article>
				<p>
					You can declare a variable in three ways:
				</p>
				<p>
					With the keyword var. For example,
				</p>
				<code>
				var x = 42.
			</code>
				<p>
					This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
				</p>
				<p>
					By simply assigning it a value. For example,
				</p>
				<code>
				x = 42.
			</code>
				<p>
					This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use
					this
					variant.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the keyword let. For example,
				</p>
				<code>
				let y = 13.
			</code>
				<p>
					This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
				</p>
				<code>
				let x = 12.
			</code>
